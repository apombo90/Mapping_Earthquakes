# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world, using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieving geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days.

## Approach
Used the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then, used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data.
